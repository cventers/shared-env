NAME
    shared-env - Maintain shared environment / dotfiles via git

SYNOPSIS
      cd ~
	  git checkout git://github.com/cventers/shared-env.git .shared-env
	  .shared-env/apply
	  . .bashrc

DESCRIPTION
    This repository contains an example configuration of a bash, git, vim and
	screen user, including dotfiles, binaries, and bash and vim plugins.

    Unlike some basic dotfile collections on github, this configuration comes
	with a simple apply script to quickly symlink relevant dotfiles into
	place, and to modify .bashrc to ensure it contains an include for the
	shared-env .bashrc.

	This allows shared-env to integrate with any local system specifics.

	This repository includes the "z" command for easily accessing your
	favorite directories. You can find that here:
